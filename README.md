# Challenging the Thrift Paradigm: When Decreasing Income Trajectory Drives Expensive Non-Conformity

This repository provides the minimal dataset and Stata replication code for the study on income trajectories and conformity behavior. This documentation ensures compliance with reproducibility standards and provides a roadmap for interpreting the data and scripts.

## 1. Minimal Dataset Overview
In accordance with the Minimal Dataset Requirement, this package provides:
- **Primary Data**: Fully de-identified raw data used to generate all key figures, tables, and statistical analyses.
- **Metadata**: Detailed descriptions of dataset structures, variable definitions, and units of measurement.
- **Code or Scripts**: Stata Do-files to reproduce all tables and figures.
- **Supporting Documentation**: This README file guiding data interpretation and script execution.

## 2. Execution Instructions and Notes
To ensure correct replication, please follow these technical requirements from the metadata:

1. **File Paths**: The first line of every Do-file contains a file path command. Users **must manually adjust** this path to match the actual folder location on their local machine before running.
2. **Software Version**: The analysis was conducted using **Stata versions 18 and 19**. It is recommended to use these versions or higher for full compatibility.
3. **Specific Script Procedures**:
   - **Heterogeneous Effects (`4.4. Heterogeneous Effects Across Demographic Groups.do`)**: An message stating "variable treatment already defined" is expected and does not impact analysis results. It is recommended to manually copy and paste execute. The script 4.4. Heterogeneous Effects Across Demographic Groups.do provides the underlying statistical evidence for the textual analysis of heterogeneity within the manuscript’s findings, and the data results used in the heterogeneous graphical representation (i.e., Figure 7) are generated by Figure 7.do.
   - **Figure 7 Signs**: The raw code calculates `C2-A2` and refers to the dy/dx. However, in the paper, the figure displays `A2-C2`, meaning the signs in the paper are reversed relative to the script output.
4. **Statistical Settings**:
   - All models use **Robust Standard Errors**.
   - Significance levels: `*** p<0.01`, `** p<0.05`, `* p<0.1`.

## 3. Do-file Mapping & Result Verification
Each script corresponds to a specific analysis or visualization in the manuscript. Please execute them in the following order if necessary:

| Manuscript Item | Stata Do-file | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Table 2** | `Table 2.do` | Tobit Regression - Counter-Conformity Effect in Income-Decrease Group (Script Output: Table 2). |
| **Table 3** | `Table 3.do` | Logistic Regression - Baseline Conformity by Income Trajectories with Info (Script Output: Table 3). |
| **Table 4** | `Table 4.do` | Logistic Regression - Role of Cheap Salience on Conformity (Script Output: Table 4). |
| **Figures A1** | `Figure A1.do` | Robustness check: Cheap product choices under income decline. |
| **Figure A2** | `Figure A2.do` | Comparison of cheap product choices under income decline: Functional products vs. symbolic products. |
| **Figure 3** | `Figure3 left.do` & `Figure3 right.do` | Mean Number of Cheap Products by Income Increase vs. Decrease. The error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. |
| **Figure 4** | `Figure4.do` | Proportion of Cheap Product Choices. |
| **Figure 5** | `Figure 5.do` | Cheap Product Choices. |
| **Figure 6** | `Figure6.do` | Social Information in Income Increasing Trajectory. |
| **Figure 7** | `Figure 7.do` | Heterogeneous Effects: (a) Gender Difference; (b) Income Difference; (c) Age Difference; (d) Residence Difference. |
| **Heterogeneity** | `4.4. Heterogeneous Effects Across Demographic Groups.do` | Robustness checks across demographic groups. |

### Special Note on Figure 7:
- **Metric**: Unlike other figures, Figure 7 focuses exclusively on the marginal effects (dy/dx).
- **Sign Convention**: The script calculates the value as `C2-A2`, whereas the manuscript presents it as `A2-C2`. Consequently, the signs in the paper are the **inverse** of those in the raw script output.

## 4. Comprehensive Summary Table of Variables (Metadata)
The following table defines the core variables used across all regression models:

| Variable | Definition | Coding / Unit of Measurement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Conformity** | Indicator of social information adherence | 1 = chooses majority option; 0 = otherwise. |
| **Income Decrease** | Pessimistic income trajectory treatment | 1 = income decrease condition; 0 = income increase. |
| **Income Increase** | Optimistic income trajectory treatment | 1 = income increase condition; 0 = income decrease. |
| **Cheap Salience** | Information regarding low-cost products | 1 = cheap information provided; 0 = expensive. |
| **Expensive Salience**| Information regarding high-cost products | 1 = cheap information provided; 0 = expensive. |
| **Income Decrease × Cheap Salience**| Interaction between pessimistic income trajectories and cheap-majority | Product of Income Decrease and Cheap Salience |
| **Gender** | Participant gender | 1 = Female; 0 = Male. |
| **Age** | Categorical age classification | 1: 18–25; 2: 26–30; 3: 31–35; 4: 36–40; 5: >40. |
| **Income** | Monthly income classification | Scale 1 (<2k) to 9 (>25k) as defined in Metadata. |
| **Residence** | Residential location type | 1 = Rural; 2 = Town; 3 = City. |
| **Growth Perception** | Perception of economic growth | 7-point Likert Scale (1: Very Pessimistic to 7: Very Optimistic). |
| **Education** | Highest educational attainment | 1: Vocational School; 2: College; 3: Bachelor; 4: Master/Ph.D. |

## 5. Supplemental Analysis for Heterogeneity
- **Textual Evidence**: The script `4.4. Heterogeneous Effects Across Demographic Groups.do` provides the underlying statistical evidence for the **textual analysis of heterogeneity** described within the manuscript’s findings.
- **Visual Evidence**: While script `4.4` informs the narrative, the data results used in the **graphical representation of heterogeneity** (i.e., Figure 7) are generated exclusively by `Figure 7.do`.
